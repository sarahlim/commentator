# commentator
Commentator is a Google Apps Script addon that makes it easy for policy debate judges to publish individual student comments.

Judges submit comments for one debate via a Google Form, separating comments by debaters. Commentator reads the form results from a Google Sheet, and appends each student's comments to their individual Google Sites page.

Used at the 2015 Northwestern Debate Institute.
